# Renewable Energy Statistics
This Power BI project visualizes key metrics for various renewable energy sources, including solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal. I have used dataset for ths project from kaggle website.

## **Charts Used:**
>**1. Energy Consumption vs Production by Sectors:** It is showing a comparison between Energy consumption and emergy production through a Clustered Column Chart across different renewable energy sectors.
>
>**Key insights:** Upon analysis, we observed that all sectors exhibit comparable energy production and consumption in MWh, with Wind Energy demonstrating marginally higher figures.

>
>**2.Storage Efficiency by Sectors:** It displays a comparison of storage efficiency percentages across different sectors using a Donut Chart.
>
>**Key Insights:** Upon analysis, we observed that all sectors have similar storage efficiency, with Wind Energy demonstrating marginally higher figures.

>**3.Jobs Created by Sectors:** It displays a comparison of jobs created across different sectors using a Donut Chart.
>
>**Key Insights:** Upon analysis, we observed that all sectors have created a similar number of jobs, with Wind Energy demonstrating marginally higher figures.

>
>**4.Financial Initiatives vs Initial Investment by Funding sources:** It is an area chart comparing the sum of Financial Initiatives given versus the initial investments by Government, Private, or Public-Private Partnerships.
>
>**Key Insights:** Upon analysis, we observed that the highest initial investment and total financial incentives are achieved through Public-Private Partnerships. Additionally, while government investments are high, the total financial incentives are relatively low, and the opposite is true for private funds.
>
>**5.Reduction Index of Air Pollution Vs GHG Emission by sectors:** Reducion index show that how much air pollution has been reduced and GHG Emission is he mesure of green house gses emitted across diffrent sectors.
